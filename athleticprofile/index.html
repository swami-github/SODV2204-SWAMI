            <h3>HISTORY</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1996 The young Roger continues to make progress and wins two national junior titles. In the meantime he has adjusted well to life in Ecublens and his French has improved as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Roger settles well into his new home in Ecublens in French-speaking Switzerland. This is also aided by his mate, Yves Allegro, a Valasian, 3 years older than Roger. He spends a lot of time with Roger, following his sporting progress with interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Roger ends the year as the number 86 in Switzerland, thus becoming a member of the A league of Swiss Tennis.
                </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In 1995 Roger is accepted by the <em>national development programme,</em>. of <b>Swiss Tennis</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is a difficult step for the 14-year old to move from his home in Basel to the national tennis centre in Ecublens.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After winning 2 national titles in 1993 in the category for 12-year olds, his parents suggested during end-1994, that he join the national development programme of Swiss Tennis.
                </li> 
                <li>
                    <i>Although Roger initially shows no interest,</i> he nevertheless decides in March 1995 to undergo the qualification.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Roger is admitted into the programme and in August he moves to his host family, the Christinets, in Ecublens, which is located on the shore of Lake Geneva in French-speaking <mark>Switzerland</mark>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <del>first months</del> are difficult for Roger; his French is not good and he is the youngest and weakest player in the training centre.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Daily <small>telephone conversations</small> with his mother, Lynette, as well as his <ins>understanding</ins> host family and his "host brother", <sup>Vincent, and finally his own will power,</sup> assist him through these troubled times.
                </li>
                <li>
                    By reaching the quarterfinals at the Orange Bowl <sub>in Key Biscayne (USA)</sub>, the most important international junior tennis tournament, <q>Roger achieves his first international success.</q>
