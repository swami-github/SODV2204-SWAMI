        <h4>DANDY IN THE UNDERWORLD</h4>
        <p>5.5% ABV</p>
        <p>The main Dandy. This beer is our most popular offering and available everywhere, all the time. A light body with notes of coffee, chocolate, and light roast, this traditional Oyster Stout is sure to be a favourite. </p>

        <h4>The DAndY Wild Sour Ale</h4>
        <p>7.3% ABV</p>
        <p>A bold, malty sour ale soured with lacto-bacillus and fermented with a wild yeast strain. An upfront sourness is balanced with notes of green mango, Sauvignon Blanc, and pineapple.<p>
        <h4>T2G-IPA</h4>
        <p>7.5% ABV</p>
        <p>A bold IPA that is all sorts of Dandy. Choosing not to take sides, this rich IPA has a present bitterness balanced with a juicy citrus aroma. </p>
        <h4>Dandy Lager</h4>
        <p>5% ABV</p>
        <p>An import style premium lager brewed with toasted rice and the finest Alberta malt. Thoughtfully hopped with prime German hops, for a subtle citrus aroma, this beer is crisp and fresh. Premium in name, Dandy in Nature.</p>


    
    <h2>Seasonal Releases</h2>
        <h3>Four exciting beers a year with wide release. Look for them when the weather begins to turn.</h3>
        <h4>Baltus Van Tassel: Cherry Sour</h4>
        <p>7% ABV</p>
        <p>Fall</p>
        <p>An American Style Cherry Sour.  A rich brown American Brown sour brewed with Sweet and Tart cherries for the perfect accompaniment to shorter days and colder weather.<p>
        <h4>In the Bleak MidWinter: Black Ipa</h4>
        <p>6.5% ABV</p>
        <p>Winter</p>
        <p>A fruity Black IPA. With only a kiss of roast, this black IPA is fresh and juicy but dark as the coldest days of winter. Citra and Mosaic are late hop additions to avoid the biterness and focus on aroma.</p>
        <h4>The Jungle Bird: Tropical Dark Sour</h4>
        <p>5% ABV</p>
        <p>Spring</p>
        <p>An homage to the classic Tiki cocktail. This beer has notes of demerara sugar, bitter lime, tropical pineapple coming together for a refreshing sour that is like no other.</p>
        <h4>Bright Young Things: Hopped Wheat Ale</h4>
        <p>5.5% ABV</p>
        <p>Summer</p>
        <p> English Summer Ale. A style developed during a late 70’s heat wave in England, this beer is designed to refresh in the hot summer sun. Dry, with a touch of wheat and toasted Victory malt, it is balanced with a touch of biterness and a sweet citrus aroma. Patios, BBQ’s, and friends all pair perfectly with this beer!</p>
