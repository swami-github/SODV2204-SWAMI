    <h1>The Tasting Room</h1> 
<h3>Serving 20 taps of exceptional craft beer, fine drinking food, cocktails and wine.</h3>

<p>Rated the best new restaurant of 2018 in the Calgary Herald, The Dandy Brewing Company and Tasting Room is a unique dining experience located in the heart of Ramsay. The modern space features 20 taps of Dandy Beers (maybe a few guest taps), a curated cocktail list featuring local spirit, and a daily selection of top quality wines available by the glass. 
Chef Merritt Gordon has put together something amazing, enhancing the already indulgent experience.
